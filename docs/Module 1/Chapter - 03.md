### Differences Between Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

### Capital Expenditure (CapEx)

- **Definition:** Capital Expenditure refers to the funds used by an organization to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as buildings, technology, or equipment.
  
- **Nature of Investment:** CapEx is typically a large, one-time investment that is aimed at creating or improving long-term assets. These assets usually have a useful life extending beyond the current financial year.
  
- **Impact on Financial Statements:** CapEx is recorded on the balance sheet as an asset and is gradually depreciated over the asset's useful life.

- **Examples:**
  - Purchasing new machinery or equipment
  - Constructing a new building
  - Upgrading technology infrastructure

### Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

- **Definition:** Operational Expenditure refers to the funds that a company spends on the day-to-day operations required to run the business, including rent, utilities, and other operational costs.
  
- **Nature of Investment:** OpEx is an ongoing, recurring expense that is necessary to maintain business operations and generate revenue. These expenses are incurred within the current financial year.
  
- **Impact on Financial Statements:** OpEx is recorded on the income statement and is fully deducted as an expense in the same year it is incurred.

- **Examples:**
  - Paying employee salaries
  - Utility bills (electricity, water)
  - Leasing office space
  - Software subscriptions or cloud services
