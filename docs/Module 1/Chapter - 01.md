## Cloud Computing

**Describe what is Cloud Computing:**

Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services over the Internet, enabling faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
### Key Components:

1. **COMPUTE:** Provides the compute power, including memory and processor resources.
2. **NETWORKING:** Involves the connection of computers or virtual machines (VMs) together.
3. **STORAGE:** Responsible for storing data and information.
4. **ANALYTICS:** Handles important tasks such as determining memory requirements, performance metrics, etc.

## Scalability

Scalability is the ability to scale. Scaling is the process of allocating (adding) or deallocating (removing) resources.

### Two Types of Scalability:

1. **Vertical Scaling (Scale Up/Down):** - Increases or decreases the compute entity, such as RAM and processor power.
   
2. **Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out/In):**- If one virtual machine (VM) is heavily utilized, traffic is shifted to another VM. This is managed by a load balancer.

## Elasticity

Elasticity is the ability to scale dynamically

## Agility

Agility is the ability to react quickly, especially when it comes to scaling resources. 

### Key Points:

- **Agility** refers to on-demand services that allow for the fast deployment of virtual machines (VMs).
- It involves using a control panel or portal to manage and adjust properties quickly and efficiently.

## Fault Tolerance

Fault tolerance is the ability to maintain system uptime even when physical or service component failures occur.

---

## Disaster Recovery

Disaster recovery is the process and design principle that allows a system to recover from natural or human-induced disasters. This involves replicating data to another location to ensure easy recovery during disasters. Disaster recovery is a critical part of maintaining high availability.

---

## High Availability

High availability refers to the agreed level of operational uptime for a system, calculated as a percentage of system uptime versus the total lifetime of the system.

- **Availability Formula:** Availability = Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)

---


## Consumption-Based Model

The consumption-based model is a pricing model where users pay based on their actual usage of resources, often referred to as "pay-as-you-go."

---

## Cost Optimization

Cost optimization involves optimizing both Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx) to achieve financial efficiency and reduce unnecessary costs.

---

## Global Reach

Global reach refers to the availability of data centers across the globe, ensuring accessibility, redundancy, and disaster recovery capabilities.

---

## Security

Security involves measures and protocols that ensure secure access to and use of applications, protecting data, infrastructure, and users.
