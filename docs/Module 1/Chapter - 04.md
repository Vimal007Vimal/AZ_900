## Consumption-Based Model

### What is a Consumption-Based Model?

The consumption-based model is a pricing model used in cloud services where customers are only charged based on their actual resource usage.

### Characteristics of the Consumption-Based Model:

- **No Associated Upfront Cost:** Customers do not need to pay any upfront fees; costs are only incurred as resources are used.

- **No Wasted Resources:** 
  - No charges are incurred for unused resources. However, "unused" can vary depending on the service:
    - **Blob Storage:** Storing any data consumes storage space, so it is considered to be in use.
    - **Virtual Machines:** Running VMs consume CPU, memory, and other resources, even if there isn't any traffic, so they are also considered in use and will incur charges.

- **Pay for What You Need:** You are only charged for the resources you actively use.

- **Stop Paying When You Donâ€™t:** Charges stop when you no longer use the resources.
